# Anyform

## `//deps`

Contains dependencies needed to develop anyform.  These will be automatically
installed when needed, if the instructions in the documentation are followed.

Automatic installation of dependencies is done via Mako and Mako.mk files.  The
only exception is Mako itself, which is installed via a git submodule, but this
is also automatically grabbed when using the Makefile as directed.
